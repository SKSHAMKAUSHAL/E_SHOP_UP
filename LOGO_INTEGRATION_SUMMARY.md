## 🎨 Implementation Details

### Code Changes Made:

```jsx
// Before (Non-clickable)
<div className="flex justify-center mb-4">
    <Logo 
        size="large" 
        showText={true} 
        variant={mode === 'dark' ? 'white' : 'gradient'}
    />
</div>

// After (Clickable to Home)
<div className="flex justify-center mb-4 cursor-pointer" onClick={() => navigate('/')}>
    <Logo 
        size="large" 
        showText={true} 
        variant={mode === 'dark' ? 'white' : 'gradient'}
    />
</div>
```

### Key Features:
- **`onClick={() => navigate('/')}`** - Navigates to home page using React Router
- **`cursor-pointer`** - Shows pointer cursor on hover to indicate it's clickable
- **Smooth Navigation** - Uses React Router for client-side routing (no page reload)

---

## 🎯 User Experience Improvements

### Before:
- ❌ Users had no quick way to return to home from these pages
- ❌ Logo was just decorative
- ❌ Had to use browser back button or manually type URL

### After:
- ✅ One click on logo returns to home page
- ✅ Intuitive UX pattern (standard across websites)
- ✅ Faster navigation
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ Professional behavior

---

## 📱 Responsive Behavior

### All Screen Sizes:
- **Mobile** (<640px): Logo remains centered and clickable
- **Tablet** (640px-1024px): Logo remains centered and clickable
- **Desktop** (>1024px): Logo remains centered and clickable

### Visual Feedback:
- **Hover**: Cursor changes to pointer
- **Click**: Smooth navigation to home page
- **No Loading**: Uses React Router (instant transition)

---

## 🌓 Dark Mode Support

All logos adapt to the current theme:
- **Light Mode**: Gradient colored logo (pink to purple)
- **Dark Mode**: White logo for better contrast
- **Smooth Transition**: Theme changes are instant

This creates a consistent, professional look across your entire application!
